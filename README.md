# Encryption Project 🔒

Encryption and decryption using RSA and AES cryptographic standards using cryptography library in python.

- **`decryption.py`**: Implements RSA key decryption, AES-CBC decryption, and signature verification with X.509 certificates.
- **Files**: Includes example plaintext (`plaintext.txt`), metadata for MAC comparisons, and cryptographic inputs.
- **Workflow**: Uses PKCS#7 padding, RSA for asymmetric, and AES for symmetric encryption.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HmonWutt/Encryption.git
   cd Encryption
   ```
2. Install dependencies (`cryptography`) and run `decryption.py`:
   ```bash
   python decryption.py
   ```
